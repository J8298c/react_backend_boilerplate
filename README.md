<h1>React FullStack Boiler Plate</h1>

<h3>Using This BoilerPlate</h3>

<p>Clone the repo, then cd into repo and run npm install || yarn install. Cd into client and run the same command.</p>

<h3>Folder Structure</h3>

<p>All the React code lives inside the <strong>client</strong> folder. Inside the package.json the script proxy is what allows React to make request to the express API server</p>
